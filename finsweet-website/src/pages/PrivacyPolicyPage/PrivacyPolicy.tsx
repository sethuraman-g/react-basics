            <p className="text-muted">Writing UX copies can be a little frustrating and confusing, and sometimes we are unsure
                about how to get the right word. To crack the code for the UX copies,we at Zeta Design wanted 
                to build a Figma plugin for the larger design community. The plugin is called
                the Ghost UXWriter and has a set of UX copies cataloged and categorized
                with a voice and tone variation ranging from plain, casual to playful.
                The intention to build this Figma plugin originated from our Medium
                blog post, ‘Designing voice and tone for error messages.
